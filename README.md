# TrustM3 - Using non-tamperable blockchain technology which allows the employer to validate employees, experience & skills.

**Winning project of Sync the City 2022**

TrustM3 is currently built atop of Unlock Protocol technology and it uses Polygon chain to enable users to mint NFT's, which are used for employers to validate the work experience, skills etc of a potential employee. 

TrustM3 has plans to create our own platform to enable us to fully customise the user experience to our liking.
